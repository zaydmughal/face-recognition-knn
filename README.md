# Face Recognition Using KNN & OpenCV ðŸ‘¦ ðŸŽ¥
 Facial recognition is a way of recognizing a human face through technology. A facial recognition system uses biometrics to map facial features from a photograph or video. It compares the information with a database of known faces to find a match.
 
 # Breakdown of the code:
1. Importing libraries
2. Create some data for classification
3. Write the kNN workflow
4. Finally, run knn on the data and observe results
